## Introduction

This project provides comprehensive steps for setting up a cloud-based environment on Azure. It includes creating and managing Virtual Machines, configuring Git for network access, setting up Storage Accounts, and deploying Static Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the setup, make sure you have:

- An active Azure subscription with permissions to create and manage resources.
- Azure CLI and Git installed on your local machine.
- A basic understanding of Azure services and Git.

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Creation of Virtual Machine

The first part of this project involves setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure. The VM will serve as the core environment for development and deployment.

### 2. Configure Git with Network

This section involves configuring Git on the Virtual Machine or local environment. This includes setting up Git for version control and ensuring it is properly connected to the network, enabling smooth collaboration and code management.

### 3. Creation of Storage Account

Creating an Azure Storage Account is crucial for managing data and resources. This section covers the steps to create and configure a Storage Account and set up containers for storing and accessing data.

### 4. Creation of Static Web Apps

In this section, you will set up and deploy a Static Web App using Azure. The Static Web App will be integrated with GitHub for continuous deployment, allowing automatic updates and management directly from the repository.
